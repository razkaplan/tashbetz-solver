# Daily improvement runbook — tashbetz solver

Read this first each run. It is the handoff between days.

## Current state (update this section every run)

| Metric | Value | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Precision (combined dev) | **96.9%** | >=95% ✓ |
| Coverage | 57% | >=70% |
| Accurate fulfilment (yield) | 55% | ~67% |
| Best single puzzle | 2026-05-29: 95% / 71% / 68% ✓ all targets | |
| Hardest puzzle | 2026-06-05: 100% / 43% / 43% | coverage stuck |

Baseline for comparison: v2 = 41% raw with untraceable errors.
Last lever added: **proof gate** (`solver/prove.py`) — commits must execute as assertions.
Last finding: coverage is bounded by CANDIDATE GENERATION, not verification. Same
conclusion the cryptic-SOTA paper reached independently.

## The policy that governs everything
A blank beats a wrong answer. Wrong letters corrupt crossings and poison later passes.
Three tiers: `committed` (asserted, proof must execute), `suggestion` (unverified, never
propagated), `blank`. Score with `python3 evals/run_eval.py <file>`.

## Each run, in order

1. **Check for a new puzzle.** A new Haaretz puzzle publishes weekly (Fri). If one exists
   that is not in `data/images/`, harvest it: the article is paywalled to anonymous
   scrapers, so the image URL must come from a logged-in browser session (see
   `project_tashbetz_solver` memory). Then transcribe clues + grid, and validate:
   every enum sum must equal the answer letter count, and `solver/grid_tools.py validate`
   must print OK. Watch for REVERSED enumerations — 6 of 50 puzzles had them.
2. **Run the current best pipeline** on a dev puzzle: precision-first pass, then
   anchor-propagating passes (`solver/pass2_patterns.py`), every commit proof-gated.
3. **Score and AUDIT.** Never report a number without: transcript scan for forbidden
   reads / solution sites / images; a tool-leak check (is any held-out answer reachable
   through a tool?); and an implausibility check — a jump over ~15 points is suspect
   until explained. This caught a 96% result that was pure leak.
4. **Try exactly ONE new lever** per run, from the queue below. One at a time, or you
   cannot attribute the change.
5. **Update the table above and append to the log.** Then stop.

## Lever queue (highest expected value first)

1. **Candidate generation** — the measured bottleneck. Generate N diverse candidates per
   clue (per mechanism, per definition-span hypothesis), then let the proof gate filter.
   Currently the solver produces one candidate and tries to justify it; that is backwards.
2. **Definition-span detection** — a cryptic clue's definition sits at one END. Classify
   which end, then solve the wordplay from the remainder. Standard in the literature,
   never tried here.
3. **Grow the corpus** — 8,249 clue-answer pairs vs ~470k used by the SOTA system. The
   tartey_mashma Google Group posts weekly scans of easier setters; transcribing those
   unlocks both retrieval and any future fine-tune. This is the long game.
4. **Global constraint optimization** — scored candidates + belief propagation over the
   grid (Berkeley Crossword Solver approach). Worth doing once candidate lists are good.
5. **Validate on the easier tier** (דקל בנו) — where 80% is realistic; tells us whether
   the harness is sound and this setter is simply hard.

## Things already tried — do not repeat
- More knowledge tooling (wiki, culture lexicon, shironet titles): helped early, now saturated.
- Raising the confidence threshold: exhausted at 0.75; higher only trades coverage away.
- LLM verifiers judging plausibility: superseded by the executable proof gate.
- Majority-vote consensus: reverses sign with run quality — helps weak runs, hurts strong ones.
- More passes: coverage went 36 -> 46 -> 57 -> 55 -> 43; passes are exhausted.

## Log
- 2026-07-28: proof gate added. Rejected 3 candidates on 06-05: 2 were genuine errors,
  1 was a correct answer lost. Precision 100%, coverage flat. Concluded candidate
  generation is the bottleneck.

## IF YOU ARE THE DAILY CLOUD AGENT — read this

The repo ships no corpus, but **you are not blocked: everything is reconstructible from
public sources.** Run this first:

    ./bootstrap.sh --dev-only     # ~2 min: lexicon, answers, culture, substitutions, dev images

That fetches the hspell lexicon (github), re-scrapes the answers corpus from 14across
(plain HTTP, no login), rebuilds culture entities from the he-wikipedia API, derives the
substitution dictionary, and downloads the dev puzzle images from the public Haaretz CDN
via the committed URL manifest. Grids are already in the repo.

The one thing it cannot script is **clue text**, which exists only inside the images.
Bootstrap step 6 tells you how to transcribe it, and you can: read the jpg, transcribe the
תשבץ היגיון clues, validate each enumeration against the answer letter count, then run
`python3 solver/build_dataset.py`. Do this for one dev puzzle and you can evaluate for real.

**So you CAN verify your work — and you must.** Run `python3 evals/run_eval.py <file>`
on anything you claim. Never state a number you did not produce by executing code.
This project already had a 96% result turn out to be a leak in its own tooling; that is
why every claim needs evidence. If you genuinely cannot run something, say so plainly
rather than estimating.

Each run:

1. **Bootstrap** (above), then confirm what you actually have.
2. **Research** — new work on cryptic solving, wordplay formalisation, definition-span
   detection, Hebrew NLP. Append to RESEARCH.md with links and an honest judgement of
   whether it transfers. Most crossword-AI work targets non-cryptic puzzles and does not.
3. **Implement exactly ONE lever** from the queue above. One, so the effect is attributable.
4. **Evaluate it** against the previous best in the state table. Audit before believing:
   scan for forbidden reads, check no tool leaks held-out answers, and treat any jump over
   ~15 points as suspect until explained.
5. **Open a PR** (never push to main) stating what you built, the measured effect, and what
   is still unverified. Update the state table and append to the Log.

A run that reports "this lever did not help, here is the evidence" is a good run.
