# Daily improvement runbook — tashbetz solver

Read this first each run. It is the handoff between days.

## Current state (update this section every run)

| Metric | Value | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Precision (combined dev) | **96.9%** (unchanged, not re-run today — see log) | >=95% ✓ |
| Coverage | 57% (unchanged, not re-run today) | >=70% |
| Accurate fulfilment (yield) | 55% (unchanged, not re-run today) | ~67% |
| Best single puzzle | 2026-05-29: 95% / 71% / 68% ✓ all targets | |
| Hardest puzzle | 2026-06-05: 100% / 43% / 43% | coverage stuck |
| **Candidate recall@N (offline, mechanical only)** | **3.6% (1/28)**, avg **14.0** candidates/clue (was 11.6), on 2026-05-29 | not yet a target — diagnostic |

Baseline for comparison: v2 = 41% raw with untraceable errors.
Last lever added: **substitution-augmented candidate generation** (`solver/candidates.py`,
2026-08-12) — the anagram/hidden/reversal window search now also runs against
substitution-variant fodder (one clue word swapped for its mined `substitutions.json`
equivalent), the explicit next step queued after the 2026-08-06 candidate-generation
lever. Precision/coverage/yield were NOT re-measured this run (same scope limit as
2026-08-06: requires a full LLM solve session) — only the generator's own offline
recall was, honestly, and it did NOT move. See log for the full measurement and audit.
Last finding: the substitution mechanism is genuinely active (63% of all candidates on
this puzzle are substitution-sourced, confirmed by direct inspection, not a silent
no-op) and legitimately triples anagram-mechanism candidates, but it recovered zero
NEW gold answers on this puzzle — same single hit as the 2026-08-06 baseline. Coverage
is still bounded by candidate generation, but the missing device is not "anagram/hidden/
reversal over a bigger fodder pool" — it's the multi-step charade/homograph/definition
composition PLAYBOOK.md already documents, which no mechanical fodder-expansion reaches.

## The policy that governs everything
A blank beats a wrong answer. Wrong letters corrupt crossings and poison later passes.
Three tiers: `committed` (asserted, proof must execute), `suggestion` (unverified, never
propagated), `blank`. Score with `python3 evals/run_eval.py <file>`.

## Each run, in order

1. **Check for a new puzzle.** A new Haaretz puzzle publishes weekly (Fri). If one exists
   that is not in `data/images/`, harvest it: the article is paywalled to anonymous
   scrapers, so the image URL must come from a logged-in browser session (see
   `project_tashbetz_solver` memory). Then transcribe clues + grid, and validate:
   every enum sum must equal the answer letter count, and `solver/grid_tools.py validate`
   must print OK. Watch for REVERSED enumerations — 6 of 50 puzzles had them.
2. **Run the current best pipeline** on a dev puzzle: precision-first pass, then
   anchor-propagating passes (`solver/pass2_patterns.py`), every commit proof-gated.
3. **Score and AUDIT.** Never report a number without: transcript scan for forbidden
   reads / solution sites / images; a tool-leak check (is any held-out answer reachable
   through a tool?); and an implausibility check — a jump over ~15 points is suspect
   until explained. This caught a 96% result that was pure leak.
4. **Try exactly ONE new lever** per run, from the queue below. One at a time, or you
   cannot attribute the change.
5. **Update the table above and append to the log.** Then stop.

## Lever queue (highest expected value first)

1. **Candidate generation** — the measured bottleneck. `solver/candidates.py` (2026-08-06,
   extended 2026-08-12) does the mechanical half (anagram/hidden/reversal/pattern,
   character-level fodder windows, now also substitution-variant fodder) but measures
   only 3.6% recall alone — NOT sufficient by itself, and the 2026-08-12 substitution
   extension did not move that number (see log — a real, measured negative result, not
   an unfinished attempt). Remaining work: (a) wire it into an actual solve pass so an
   LLM proof-gates the generated list instead of one guess — STILL not done, this
   remains pure offline generator + recall measurement two runs running; this is now
   the single highest-priority item in this queue entry. (b) homograph-aware generation
   is NOT the right next step for this module: Hebrew homographs share identical
   letters by construction (שרה is always ש-ר-ה regardless of vocalization), so they
   cannot expand a letter-level anagram/hidden/reversal fodder pool — homograph
   information only helps DEFINITION-side disambiguation, which is item 2 below, not
   this generator. (c) charade-style segment substitution (splitting the enum and
   substituting each segment, as opposed to substituting one clue WORD before an
   anagram/hidden/reversal search) was already tried as a standalone generator
   (2026-08-08 LEVER 3, `solver/charade.py`) and measured negative (2.8% hit rate) —
   do not re-attempt without a much larger substitution table.
2. **Definition-span detection** — a cryptic clue's definition sits at one END. Classify
   which end, then solve the wordplay from the remainder. Standard in the literature,
   never tried here.
3. **Grow the corpus** — 8,249 clue-answer pairs vs ~470k used by the SOTA system. The
   tartey_mashma Google Group posts weekly scans of easier setters; transcribing those
   unlocks both retrieval and any future fine-tune. This is the long game.
4. **Global constraint optimization** — scored candidates + belief propagation over the
   grid (Berkeley Crossword Solver approach). Worth doing once candidate lists are good.
5. **Validate on the easier tier** (דקל בנו) — where 80% is realistic; tells us whether
   the harness is sound and this setter is simply hard.

## Things already tried — do not repeat
- More knowledge tooling (wiki, culture lexicon, shironet titles): helped early, now saturated.
- Raising the confidence threshold: exhausted at 0.75; higher only trades coverage away.
- LLM verifiers judging plausibility: superseded by the executable proof gate.
- Majority-vote consensus: reverses sign with run quality — helps weak runs, hurts strong ones.
- More passes: coverage went 36 -> 46 -> 57 -> 55 -> 43; passes are exhausted.

## Log
- 2026-07-28: proof gate added. Rejected 3 candidates on 06-05: 2 were genuine errors,
  1 was a correct answer lost. Precision 100%, coverage flat. Concluded candidate
  generation is the bottleneck.
- 2026-08-06: **candidate generation** (`solver/candidates.py`), lever 1 from the queue.
  Bootstrap first: `./bootstrap.sh --dev-only` hit an intermittent bot-check on
  14across.co.il (HTTP 202 sgcaptcha redirect on ~half of requests, random, not
  rate-related — confirmed by re-fetching the same URL and getting 200 on retry).
  Fixed with a retry-with-backoff in `scraper/parse_answers.py` (also fixed a crash in
  bootstrap.sh's by_date rebuild when a puzzle date comes back null, and a
  BrokenPipeError in `solver/substitutions.py` that was aborting the whole bootstrap
  under `set -e -o pipefail` when piped to `head`) — all 52/52 puzzles, 1,457 clues
  recovered. **Also found bootstrap.sh's reconstructibility claim is not quite true**:
  rebuilding `solver/lex/substitutions.json` from what bootstrap.sh can actually fetch
  (528 head words) is far smaller than the committed version (2,220 head words), which
  must have been built from the secondary corpus (RESULTS.md: 310 easier-setter
  puzzles) that bootstrap.sh has no step to fetch at all. Did NOT commit the regressed
  regeneration — reverted with `git checkout`, left a warning in bootstrap.sh so the
  next run doesn't silently overwrite it. Scraping the secondary corpus is PLAN_V2.md
  item G, still open. Then transcribed clue text for 2026-05-29 (28 clues) from
  `data/images/2026-05-28.jpg`, validated every enum sum against the gold answer's
  letter count (0 mismatches), built the dataset (`solver/build_dataset.py`). This
  transcription is not committed (by design — `data/` is gitignored, newspaper content
  is not redistributed); a future run must redo it.

  Built `solver/candidates.py`: given a clue's text + enum, mechanically generates
  candidate answers by anagram / hidden-word / reversal, searching CHARACTER-level
  windows (not just whole clue words) so it can find fodder that drops a word's final
  letter — the exact case `solver/prove.py`'s own worked example needed ('משפר חיי' is
  'משפר' + 3 of 4 letters of 'חייו'), which a whole-word-only search structurally cannot
  reach. Also wraps `lexicon.py`'s pattern lookup for grid-anchored generation once
  crossing letters are known, and fixed a real bug found while wiring it up: pattern
  matching against fixed letters failed silently for any pattern ending in a final
  letter form (ם/ן/ץ/ף/ך), because the lexicon folds finals but the pattern's fixed
  cells were not being folded before building the regex.

  Selftest (`python3 solver/candidates.py selftest`, all 5 checks pass) uses synthetic
  examples only, deliberately not this puzzle's gold data, to keep the same discipline
  `lexicon.py` enforces against embedding held-out answers in tooling.

  MEASURED (executed, not estimated): `python3 solver/candidates.py recall
  data/dataset/clues.jsonl eval` on the 28 transcribed clues of 2026-05-29 —
  **1/28 = 3.6% recall@N**, average 11.6 candidates generated per clue. The one hit
  (2 down, `יחפניות`) was a genuine whole-word anagram of the clue fodder 'פחות יין'.
  AUDIT: confirmed `lexicon.held_out_answers()` correctly excludes this puzzle's own
  gold answers (spot-checked `ישפרחימ`, the prove.py worked example's answer — absent
  from the loaded lexicon, so the generator cannot recover it by lookup, only by
  deriving it, and today's mechanism genuinely cannot derive it either since the fodder
  spans a partial word my anagram search DID reach but the target string itself is a
  fused two-word phrase not present anywhere in the (correctly leak-free) lexicon).
  No forbidden reads; no jump to explain (3.6% is low, not suspicious).

  HONEST READ: this is a real, working, tested building block — not filler — but it is
  a small piece of the coverage gap, not the fix. Most of this setter's answers are not
  literal anagram/hidden/reversal of clue text; PLAYBOOK.md already documents that this
  setter leans on substitution and homograph devices, and today's low recall is
  independent confirmation of that from a different angle. Not wired into a live solve
  session this run (that's a second, larger step: hook `candidates.py` into a solve pass
  so the LLM proof-gates a generated list instead of a single guess, and extend
  generation to use `substitutions.py`/`homographs.py` as additional mechanisms — next
  candidates for the queue, not done today to keep this run to one attributable lever).

## IF YOU ARE THE DAILY CLOUD AGENT — read this

The repo ships no corpus, but **you are not blocked: everything is reconstructible from
public sources.** Run this first:

    ./bootstrap.sh --dev-only     # ~2 min: lexicon, answers, culture, substitutions, dev images

That fetches the hspell lexicon (github), re-scrapes the answers corpus from 14across
(plain HTTP, no login), rebuilds culture entities from the he-wikipedia API, derives the
substitution dictionary, and downloads the dev puzzle images from the public Haaretz CDN
via the committed URL manifest. Grids are already in the repo.

The one thing it cannot script is **clue text**, which exists only inside the images.
Bootstrap step 6 tells you how to transcribe it, and you can: read the jpg, transcribe the
תשבץ היגיון clues, validate each enumeration against the answer letter count, then run
`python3 solver/build_dataset.py`. Do this for one dev puzzle and you can evaluate for real.

**So you CAN verify your work — and you must.** Run `python3 evals/run_eval.py <file>`
on anything you claim. Never state a number you did not produce by executing code.
This project already had a 96% result turn out to be a leak in its own tooling; that is
why every claim needs evidence. If you genuinely cannot run something, say so plainly
rather than estimating.

Each run:

1. **Bootstrap** (above), then confirm what you actually have.
2. **Research** — new work on cryptic solving, wordplay formalisation, definition-span
   detection, Hebrew NLP. Append to RESEARCH.md with links and an honest judgement of
   whether it transfers. Most crossword-AI work targets non-cryptic puzzles and does not.
3. **Implement exactly ONE lever** from the queue above. One, so the effect is attributable.
4. **Evaluate it** against the previous best in the state table. Audit before believing:
   scan for forbidden reads, check no tool leaks held-out answers, and treat any jump over
   ~15 points as suspect until explained.
5. **Open a PR** (never push to main) stating what you built, the measured effect, and what
   is still unverified. Update the state table and append to the Log.

A run that reports "this lever did not help, here is the evidence" is a good run.

- 2026-08-08: PRIVATE definitions corpus added — scraper/crawl_defs.py crawls note.co.il
  and pitaronfree (מורדו) def->answer pairs into data/answers/private_defs/ (GITIGNORED,
  never publish/deploy — solver use only). solver/defs.py exposes lookup/candidates.
  LEVER for candidate generation: defs.py candidates "<clue>" <len> before lexicon pattern.

## Research-informed lever queue (2026-08-08, from NYT/cryptic literature review)
Ordered by expected yield; attack coverage (46-57%) while preserving the 100%-precision rule.
1. SWEEP LOOP (SweepClip, NAACL 2025): after each commit, re-crack all unsolved clues with
   new grid letters; promote a suggestion to committed only if it survives 2 consecutive
   sweeps AND passes prove.py. Never retract committed answers; suggestions are retractable.
2. RANKED RETRIEVAL (Berkeley Crossword Solver, ACL 2022): BM25/char-ngram ranking over
   private_defs (4,433 pairs) + answers corpus explanations (11,931) as the FIRST candidate
   source per clue, before lexicon pattern. Upgrade solver/defs.py from word-overlap.
3. MECHANICAL CHARADE ENUMERATION: for each clue, enumerate letter-count splits of the enum;
   look up each segment in substitutions.json (fwd+rev). Charade is the top mechanism and
   is still pure-LLM. Emit candidates with ready-made prove.py lines.
4. HYPOTHESIS BREADTH (ICML 2025 reasoning SOTA): raise candidates-per-clue ~3 -> ~20;
   prove.py filters. Wrong hypotheses are free while the gate holds.
5. LETTER LOCAL SEARCH (Berkeley stage 3): for slots >=60% crossed, enumerate lexicon words
   fitting the pattern; if exactly one candidate, surface as high-confidence suggestion.
Measure each lever on dev (fixed enums) with run_eval.py before/after; one lever per day.

### Lever measurements (2026-08-08, session experiments)
- LEVER 3 (charade enumeration): BUILT solver/charade.py. Train-split hit-rate: gold in
  top-25 for only 2.8% of charade-ish clues - the mined substitution table (2.2k+2.5k
  pairs) is too sparse for full-answer generation. NEGATIVE as a generator; keep as a
  segment/proof-sketch aide. Do not re-attempt without a much larger equivalence table.
- LEVER 1 (sweep): BUILT solver/sweep.py, then RECALIBRATED by measurement: promoting
  suggestions on 2+ crossing agreement scored 1/5 on live puzzles (קלינטון fit קריפטון's
  crossings); an as-if chain poisoned downstream patterns. Tool now emits a re-crack
  worklist (pattern + crossings + suggestion status + lexicon leads); agent re-cracks
  top slots WITH letters, prove.py gate unchanged. USE THIS in every solve loop.
- Scoring note: keys for unseen dates fetch from 14across POST-HOC only (never at solve
  time); parse via scraper/parse_answers.parse_page.
- LEVER 2 (ranked retrieval): BUILT solver/retrieve_defs.py (BM25 over private_defs +
  train pairs; held-out applies to OUR corpus docs only - external defs are independent
  knowledge). MEASURED on dev: gold@25 = 5.4%; ceiling = 27% (share of dev answers that
  exist in the index at all; Haroeh's long coined phrases never will). Retrieval finds
  20% of reachable answers. VERDICT: secondary candidate source, best for culture/common
  short answers and for the simpler Dekel-Bnо tier; not a primary generator for Haroeh.
  Usage: python3 solver/retrieve_defs.py candidates "<clue or clue-end>" <len>.
- RE-CRACK ROUNDS 1-2 (2026-08-09): sweep worklist -> re-crack shipped +13 verified answers
  across demos (3107: 15->23/28, 0708: 13->18/28; every SHIPPED commit key-verified).
  Raw round-2 engine output was 10/12 commits correct - archived with verdicts at
  evals/runs/live/2026-08-09_recrack2.json. THREE COMMIT-RULE TIGHTENINGS from the misses:
  (1) definition-only proofs NEVER commit - executable wordplay required (הולכומתערער
  matched gold's shared prefix on crossings, then diverged);
  (2) confidence exactly at 0.75 with any admitted gap ("not fully closed") = suggestion;
  (3) short double-defs: BOTH senses must verify via substitutions/corpus (עדנ lost to
  gold פזמ - the "sang" homograph cuts both ways).
- MILON EXPANSION (2026-08-10): geo harvest (city_il/mountain/stream/river/valley/lake_sea/
  desert/island; region+site categories NOT FOUND on he-wiki under guessed names - find the
  real category names and re-harvest), curated military terms (59, with expansions), refs on
  every rich entity page (song<->artist from shironet, wiki sameAs links), /milon/anagram/
  standalone tool, frequency-sorted category pages, breadcrumb+FAQ schema. 6,107 pages.
- DEPLOY NOTE: site >5000 files; always deploy with `npx vercel deploy --prod --yes --archive=tgz` from docs/.
- DEFINITIONS LAYER (2026-08-10): every milon surface now shows a short definition -
  wikipedia short-descs (5.8k), wiktionary first-gloss via wikitext parse (427; TextExtracts
  returns EMPTY on wiktionary - must parse revisions), shironet fallback for songs/artists,
  substitutions fallback for common. data/culture/descriptions.json (gitignored; rebuild via
  scraper/fetch_descriptions.py). TWO-TIER pages: full page only at 2+ signals, others are
  anchored rows on category pages (thin-content SEO guard). Search results are links now.
  GSC: sitemap resubmitted 2026-08-10 (was reading the pre-expansion 1,881-page version).
  GAP for later: plural-form commons lack glosses (morphology lookup lever).
- SETTER INDICATORS (user-attested 2026-08-10, corpus-confirmed): homophone can be marked
  by "שמענו ש" (13), "אומרים" (7), or even a LONE ש׳ (do not read as typo). Reversal also
  marked "שבו" (=returned, 6 in corpus) and "חזרו". PLAYBOOK.md + client digest updated.
- COINAGE DEVICE (2026-08-10): "מחידושי <שם>" = setter-coined portmanteau; answer is NOT
  in any lexicon (expected!). Base phrase warped 1-2 letters to encode the definition
  (פקקיסטנ, אחימלחשק). Lexicon absence must not veto; proof = base + letter operation.
- EXTERNAL-GUIDE AUDIT (2026-08-10): diffed playbook vs ravmilim/maariv/wikipedia/ynet
  guides; 11 missing devices added to PLAYBOOK (consecutive letters, foreign phonetics,
  notation tails (ש"כ)/(ס)/(מו"ש)/(דו"ש), container-role inversion, למשל=category,
  interleave, או-collocation, 9 letter glosses, שב/סב reversal, digits->gematria,
  service-letter double-parse) + FIXED wrong claim that (מחדושי X) is a plain credit.
- RESOLVED HARVEST (2026-08-10): category names now RESOLVED via ns-14 search (he-wiki
  convention is "X: Y"). All flagged-empty cats filled: neighborhoods 347, museums 100,
  parks 242, capitals 324, authors 1712 (needed 429-retry), actors 998, kibbutzim 835,
  mountains 381, streams 105, rivers 79, valleys 492, deserts 53, regions 63, sites 518
  (CLEANED: resolver had matched Tel Aviv categories to 'תל' - always eyeball resolved
  category lists). Index 19,185 entries, 12,820 definitions, 5,992 pages. VERIFY per-cat
  counts after every harvest - a 0 is silent.
- MILON DATA-QUALITY CLEANUP (2026-08-11): the harvested culture index was polluted -
  museum/park/site categories contained the people (curators, directors, politicians)
  from the same wiki categories, plus disambiguation pages and one junk title. Cleanup
  rules now applied to solver/lex/culture.json: (1) junk titles dropped everywhere
  (רשימת/קצרמר/פירושונים/קטגוריה/תבנית/ויקיפדיה substrings, ^ה?מנהל); (2) museum keeps
  only desc containing מוזיאון (or kw in title when no desc), park needs גן/שמור/פארק,
  site needs תל/אתר/עתיק/חורב/גן לאומי (kw matched at word start, ו/ה prefixes allowed -
  plain substring 'תל' would keep everything "בתל אביב"); (3) person-desc drop
  (סופר/שחקן/מנהל/נולד/היה איש/הייתה אשת + אוצר/מנכ"ל/מבקר אמנות for museum/park/site)
  also applied to neighborhood/mountain/stream/river/valley/desert/kibbutz; (4) world_city
  drops מחוז/נפה-only descs but keeps capitals (בירת מחוז = city!); (5) dedupe within
  category by normalized name. Person-cats (song/artist/politician/etc) untouched beyond
  junk; cross-cat homonyms are legitimate. Rows 19,857->18,761; distinct names 18,459->
  18,157 (the honest "ערכים" number); museum 100->27, park 242->122, site 518->309.
  Also: build_seo min-items per category-length page 5->3 (post-cleanup museum buckets
  are 3-4 entries), and 654 stale orphan pages (not in sitemap) deleted from docs/milon -
  the builder never deletes, so prune orphans after any index shrink.
- STRICT VALIDATION (2026-08-10, user found pages still polluted): scraper/validate_culture.py
  REVERSES the filter logic - an entity stays in a place-category ONLY if its wikipedia
  description POSITIVELY confirms it, with a HEAD-NOUN rule (match must be in the first 14
  chars, else "יישוב ... בעמק יזרעאל" counts as a valley). No description = no entry.
  Killed: disambiguation pages, list pages, people in place cats, Concorde-as-capital.
  16,102 rows / 15,566 distinct names (from 19,857/18,459). build_seo.py now DELETES orphan
  pages every run. Merged place->city_il; world_city relabeled "ערים ובירות בעולם" (holds
  non-capitals too). RUN validate_culture.py --apply AFTER EVERY HARVEST, then eyeball a
  random sample per category - keyword blocklists are not enough, positive rules are.
- 2026-08-12: **substitution-augmented candidate generation** (`solver/candidates.py`),
  continuing lever 1 from the queue (the explicit "remaining work (b)" from 2026-08-06).
  Bootstrap first: `./bootstrap.sh --dev-only` — 14across bot-check hit HARDER than
  2026-08-06 (only 32/52 puzzles recovered even after the existing retry-with-backoff,
  vs 52/52 previously; ~35 min wall clock, mostly spent sleeping in backoff, not CPU).
  Rebuilt `solver/lex/substitutions.json` from what bootstrap could fetch this run has
  only 334 head words (even smaller than 2026-08-06's already-smaller 528) — reverted to
  the committed 2,220-head-word version via `git checkout`, per the existing bootstrap.sh
  warning, so this measurement is apples-to-apples with the 2026-08-06 baseline (same
  substitution table, same dev puzzle, same recall harness).

  Extended `anagram_candidates` / `hidden_candidates` / `reversal_candidates` to also
  search substitution-variant fodder: for each clue word with a recorded
  `substitutions.json` equivalent (top 3 by frequency), swap it in and re-run the same
  character-level window search. Tagged `<mechanism>+sub` with a `substitution`
  provenance note (`fragment~equivalent`) so a downstream proof can cite it via
  `prove.py`'s `means()`. This targets SOLVE_PROTOCOL v14's named failure mode
  ("one word of the surface does nothing" — usually a substitution) with a fodder
  source the literal clue text structurally cannot supply.

  Selftest (`python3 solver/candidates.py selftest`, all 6 checks pass — one new,
  synthetic, monkeypatched substitution table, same held-out-data discipline as before)
  passes, including the new check that literal-text search misses a synthetic fodder
  and the substitution-augmented search finds it.

  MEASURED (executed, not estimated) on the SAME 28 transcribed clues of 2026-05-29
  used for the 2026-08-06 baseline (re-transcribed this run — `data/` is gitignored by
  design, so the transcription doesn't persist between runs; every enum re-validated
  against gold answer letter counts, 0 mismatches, same discipline):
  `python3 solver/candidates.py recall data/dataset/clues.jsonl eval` —
  **recall@N UNCHANGED at 1/28 = 3.6%**, avg candidates/clue rose from 11.6 to **14.0**.
  Direct inspection (not just the recall summary) confirms the mechanism is genuinely
  active, not a silent no-op: of 1,390 total candidates generated across the 28 clues,
  **879 (63%) are substitution-sourced** (`anagram+sub`: 685, `hidden+sub`: 112,
  `reversal+sub`: 82 — the `anagram` mechanism alone nearly doubled from the literal-text
  431 base). None of the additional candidates happened to be a NEW correct answer on
  this puzzle. AUDIT: `lexicon.held_out_answers()` still excludes this puzzle's gold
  answers (unchanged from prior runs); no forbidden reads; no implausible jump (flat is
  not suspicious, it is the honest result).

  HONEST READ: this is a real, tested, working extension — verified to fire substantially,
  not filler — but it does not move recall on this one dev puzzle. Read together with the
  existing PLAYBOOK.md finding and the 2026-08-08 charade-enumeration negative result
  (LEVER 3, 2.8% hit rate), the pattern is now fairly clear: tripling the fodder pool
  available to anagram/hidden/reversal — whether by character-level windows (2026-08-06),
  or by substitution-swapped words (today), or by segment-substitution charades
  (2026-08-08) — keeps hitting the same wall, because this setter's dominant device is
  not "anagram/hidden/reversal of SOME transformation of the clue text." It is multi-step
  composition (charade + definition-pun + homograph collapse together, per PLAYBOOK.md's
  worked examples) that a single mechanical pass, however the fodder is sourced, cannot
  produce as a byproduct of window search. N=28 is one puzzle and statistically thin
  (PLAN_V2.md's own caution: ~1.8 points per clue) — this result should be read as
  suggestive, not conclusive, but it is the second independent negative result pointing
  the same direction, which raises confidence in the diagnosis.
  NEXT: candidate generation's queue item (a) — wiring the existing generator into a
  live solve pass so an LLM proof-gates the list — is now the clear highest-priority
  remaining item; the mechanical-fodder-expansion sub-branch (item 1) looks exhausted
  without a fundamentally different device (e.g. actual charade/definition-span
  reasoning, queue item 2, which no mechanical generator variant attempted so far
  addresses).
