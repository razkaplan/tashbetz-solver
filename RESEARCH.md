# Research log — daily improvement agent

One entry per run: what was found, one-line summary, and an honest judgement of whether
it transfers to a Hebrew cryptic solver with an 8k-clue corpus. Default skepticism: most
crossword-AI work targets non-cryptic (American-style) puzzles and does not transfer.

**"A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving"** (arXiv 2506.04824,
ICML 2025). https://arxiv.org/html/2506.04824v1
Pipeline: an LM hypothesises answer candidates + wordplay explanations, a second LM
formalises each explanation as executable code, a verifier runs it and only accepts
proofs that execute cleanly; SOTA on Cryptonite (Times/Telegraph cryptics).
**Transfer: already adopted, and only half-adopted until today.** `solver/prove.py`
already implements the verify-by-execution half of this pipeline (added in a prior
run, credited in its own docstring). What was missing was the OTHER half — the paper
generates candidates first, then verifies; this project was doing the reverse (one
hand-picked guess, then trying to justify it after the fact), which DAILY.md and
RESULTS.md both independently flagged as the measured bottleneck. Today's lever
(`solver/candidates.py`) is the direct transfer of that missing half: mechanical,
multi-mechanism candidate enumeration (anagram/hidden/reversal/pattern) so prove.py has
a list to filter instead of a single guess to rationalize. The paper's own honest
finding — "the weakest link is the wordplay 'Aha', humans still generate wordplay
current models can't" — matches this project's own diagnosis in PLAYBOOK.md that this
setter leans on substitution/homograph devices a pure mechanical generator can't invent.

**"What Makes Cryptic Crosswords Challenging for LLMs?"** (arXiv 2412.09012, Dec 2024).

Studies English cryptic clues, including definition-span identification: giving a model
the correct definition span (one end of the clue) measurably improves solve accuracy,
consistent with the standard human-solver heuristic that a cryptic clue definition sits
entirely at one end. **Transfer: structurally yes, technically no.** The *structural*
claim (definition-at-one-end) already appears in this project's own
`solver/SOLVE_PROTOCOL.md` and is queue item (b), not invented by this paper — it is
independent confirmation the heuristic is worth building, not new information. The
*technical* approach (FastText-embedding similarity between a generated definition span
and candidate answers, trained/tuned on English clue corpora) does not transfer as-is:
there is no equivalent Hebrew embedding space tuned for this genre, and this project's
8,249-clue corpus is thin for training a dedicated span classifier from scratch. A
Hebrew definition-span detector here would have to be rule/heuristic-based (first N
words vs. last N words, scored by whether the OTHER end's residual parses as a wordplay
device) rather than learned — worth trying, but as a distinct, smaller lever, not a
drop-in port of this paper.

**Hebrew morphological segmentation (RFTokenizer, HebPipe, root-pattern morphology
evaluations in LLMs, 2025).**
https://github.com/NNLP-IL/Hebrew-Resources/blob/master/models_tools_services.rst ,
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.15773
General-purpose Hebrew morphological analyzers/segmenters and a 2025 evaluation of how
well LLMs represent Semitic root-pattern morphology (finding: tokenizer alignment with
morphology is neither necessary nor sufficient for a model to generate it correctly).
**Transfer: plausible but not attempted today.** This project's homograph/substitution
handling (`solver/homographs.py`, `solver/substitutions.py`) is already hand-built
against this specific corpus and works at the whole-word level; a real morphological
analyzer could in principle strip construct-state and prefix/suffix inflections (ב/ל/
מ/ש/ה/ו/כ) more systematically than the current ad hoc prefix-stripping in
`fix_enums.py`'s scoring heuristic. Flagging as a possible future lever for
`candidates.py`'s fodder-window search (letting windows trim a leading Hebrew clitic
before checking anagram/hidden matches), not pursued today to keep this run to one
lever.

**"Proving that Cryptic Crossword Clue Answers are Correct"** (arXiv 2407.08824,
Jul 2024). https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08824v1
Companion paper to the ICML 2025 work already logged 2026-08-06 (2506.04824) — same
verify-by-execution idea, earlier version, with one detail the later paper's abstract
didn't surface: candidate *re-ranking* uses the definition span specifically —
generate the definition span (via a fine-tuned Llama-3), then rank crossword-word
candidates of the right pattern by FastText cosine-similarity to that span, and take
the closest match as the semantic anchor alongside the mechanical wordplay derivation.
**Transfer: the structural idea is a genuine gap in today's lever, the technical
approach is not portable.** Fetched the full method (not just the abstract) to check
specifically because it bears on definition-span detection, queue item 2. Confirmed,
in the paper's own words: this is *not* a rule-based or explicitly-trained span
detector — it's LLM-generated (the fine-tuned model produces the definition text
directly) and the paper reports no isolated accuracy number for span detection alone,
so there is no benchmark number to target. The re-ranking step depends on FastText
embeddings trained on English and a UK-newspaper training corpus; neither transfers to
Hebrew, and the paper's own discussion section says as much about non-English cryptics
generally. What *does* transfer conceptually: today's `candidates.py` mechanisms
(anagram/hidden/reversal/substitution/homograph, this run's lever) generate candidates
but do not yet rank or filter them by semantic closeness to a definition span — that
remains a real, unfilled gap matching queue item 2, and this paper is evidence a
definition-span signal is worth having once it exists, not evidence for how to build
one in Hebrew. A Hebrew equivalent would need either a Hebrew sentence embedding model
(available, e.g. AlephBERT-derived) or a hand-built heuristic (first-N-words vs
last-N-words, scored by whether the *other* end's residual parses as wordplay) — still
unattempted, still a distinct smaller lever from today's.

**"Language Models are Crossword Solvers"** (arXiv 2406.09043) and the general
crossword-AI literature (Berkeley Crossword Solver, Dr. Fill, Proverb) — checked again,
no new transferable finding beyond what PLAYBOOK.md and PLAN_V2.md already extracted
(global constraint optimisation over ranked candidates, item A in PLAN_V2.md, still not
implemented — candidate generation is upstream of that and had to come first).
**Transfer: none new.** These systems solve non-cryptic (American-style) grid puzzles
where "candidate" means "any dictionary word of the right length crossing existing
letters" — there is no wordplay-decoding step, which is the entire difficulty of this
project's puzzles. Confirms DAILY.md's standing skepticism.
